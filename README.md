# Welcome to familr.
`pronounced: familiar`

The objective of this project is to make a simple to use family tree manager, so that everybody can use it to make their own family trees.
Why? Because to be able to go where we want to go, we need to understand where we come from.
And, because the only usable tool in our opinion was gramps, which is way too complicated. 

familr promises to:
  - be simple to use, for everyone
  - help visualize your families evolution over time and space
  - help you host your own family trees
  - make building familiy trees with your family fun
  - (eventually) conform to genealogy standards like GEDCOM+
  - (eventually) support interoperability with other genealogy softwares
  - be lightning fast and responsive

Though, a pinch of salt:
As the maintainer of this project, I have to let you know that I don't know MEAN, Javascript, or even Programming. I am motivated by the need of this project, and I am willing to learn. Let's hope that works out in the longer run. Expect really **messed up** code in the project to begin with.

Also why, the project is a collection of HTML concepts right now.

Godbless and Godspeed.

**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**
