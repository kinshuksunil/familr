        <h1>Welcome to familr.</h1>
        <p class="flow-text"><em>pronounced: familiar</em><br /><br />The objective of this project is to make a simple to use family tree manager, so that everybody can use it to make their own family trees.</p>
        <p class="flow-text">Why? Because to be able to go where we want to go, we need to understand where we come from.</p>
        <p class="flow-text">And, because the only usable tool in our opinion was gramps, which is way too complicated. familr promises to:
          <ul class="collection">
            <li class="collection-item">be simple to use, for everyone</li>
            <li class="collection-item">help visualize your families evolution over time and space</li>
            <li class="collection-item">help you host your own family trees</li>
            <li class="collection-item">make building familiy trees with your family fun</li>
            <li class="collection-item">(eventually) conform to genealogy standards like GEDCOM+</li>
            <li class="collection-item">(eventually) support interoperability with other genealogy softwares</li>
            <li class="collection-item">be lightning fast and responsive</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">Though, a pinch of salt:<br />As the maintainer of this project, I have to let you know that I don't know MEAN, Javascript, or even Programming. I am motivated by the need of this project, and I am willing to learn. Let's hope that works out in the longer run. Expect really <strong>messed up</strong> code in the project to begin with.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">Also why, the project is a collection of HTML concepts right now.<br /><br />Godbless and Godspeed.</p>
